# House-Price-Prediction
This project is centered around the development of a predictive system that estimates house
prices using machine learning techniques. The core objective is to utilize historical housing
data to build a model that can accurately forecast property values in California based on a
range of influencing factors.

By analyzing key features such as median income, house age, average number of rooms,
population density, average occupancy, and geographical coordinates (latitude and
longitude), the model uncovers complex relationships that influence housing prices. These
insights enable the prediction of property values with a high degree of precision.
The system is powered by the California Housing Dataset, which is processed and modeled
using the XGBoost Regressor, a robust and efficient machine learning algorithm known for
its accuracy in regression tasks. The trained model is deployed through an intuitive and
interactive Streamlit web application, allowing users to enter feature values and instantly
receive predicted house prices.

This user-friendly platform removes the complexity of traditional real estate valuation
methods and empowers users—ranging from homebuyers and investors to real estate
professionals—with data-driven insights to make informed decisions. By providing fast,
accessible, and reliable predictions, the project contributes to the broader goal of
democratizing real estate intelligence and bridging the gap between machine learning and
practical applications in the housing market.
